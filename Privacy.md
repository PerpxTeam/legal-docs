# Privacy Policy

> Effective Date: 22/12/2025

## **1\. Introduction**

PerpX Wallet ("We", "Us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our non-custodial EVM wallet application.

CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: We are a non-custodial wallet. We NEVER access, store, or transmit your unencrypted private keys, seed phrases, or your transaction passwords.

## **2\. Information We Collect**

### **2.1 Information You Provide**

* Email Address: Collected when you register or use the cloud recovery feature. This is used solely to authenticate your identity and retrieve your encrypted backup.  
* Encrypted Keystore: When you use cloud backup, an encrypted version of your key (Keystore) is generated. Without your password, this file is unreadable to us.

### **2.2 Information Collected Automatically**

* Device Information: Device model, OS version, and unique identifiers for security and debugging.  
* Blockchain Data: Public wallet addresses, transaction history, and token balances. This information is public on the blockchain and not proprietary to us.

## **3\. How We Use Your Information**

We use your data to:

* Provide Wallet Services: Verify your email to restore your encrypted wallet backup.  
* Execute Transactions: Broadcast your signed transactions to the blockchain network.  
* Gas Abstraction (Pay with USDC): Facilitate the "Pay Gas with USDC" feature by transmitting transaction details to third-party providers (e.g., Circle).  
* Improve App Stability: Analyze crash logs and performance data.

## **4\. Third-Party Data Sharing**

We do not sell your personal data. We share data only as necessary for app functionality:

* Cloud Storage Providers (Google & Apple):  
  * If you enable Google Drive or iCloud backup, your encrypted Keystore is stored directly on their servers, subject to their respective privacy policies.  
* Payment & Infrastructure Providers (Circle):  
  * To enable gas payments via USDC, transaction data (sender address, amount, nonce) is shared with Circle or other Paymaster services to execute the meta-transaction.  
* RPC Node Providers:  
  * Your IP address and wallet address may be visible to the blockchain nodes used to broadcast transactions.

## **5\. Data Security**

* Encryption: All data transmission between the App and our servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL.  
* User Responsibility: You are responsible for keeping your Password safe. Since we do not store your password, we cannot decrypt your data if you lose it.

## **6\. Your Rights & Account Deletion**

In compliance with App Store and Google Play policies:

* Account Deletion: You may request to delete your account via the "Settings" menu in the App.  
* Impact of Deletion: Upon deletion, we will permanently remove your email address and any backup files stored on our servers.  
  * WARNING: Deleting your account does not delete your address from the blockchain, but it removes your backup. If you do not have your private key saved elsewhere, you will lose access to your funds permanently.

## **7\. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App.
